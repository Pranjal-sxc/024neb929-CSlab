    <h2>Overview of Chapter 1: Computer System</h2>
    <p>This chapter provides an in-depth introduction to computer systems, their components, types, and applications in various fields. A computer system is an integrated set of hardware and software designed to process data and perform tasks efficiently.</p>

    <h2>What is a Computer System?</h2>
    <p>A computer system consists of hardware (the physical components) and software (the programs and applications) that work together to perform a variety of tasks. The primary function of a computer system is to accept input, process that input, store data, and produce output. This functionality allows computers to be used in numerous applications, from simple calculations to complex simulations.</p>

    <h2>History of Computers</h2>
    <p>The history of computers can be traced back to ancient times, but the modern computer as we know it began to take shape in the 20th century:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Abacus (circa 500 BC):</strong> One of the earliest known computing devices, used for basic arithmetic calculations.</li>
        <li><strong>Charles Babbage (1837):</strong> Designed the Analytical Engine, considered the first mechanical computer, which introduced concepts like the stored program.</li>
        <li><strong>ENIAC (1945):</strong> The first general-purpose electronic digital computer, capable of performing a wide range of calculations.</li>
        <li><strong>Transistors (1950s):</strong> Replaced vacuum tubes, making computers smaller, faster, and more reliable.</li>
        <li><strong>Microprocessors (1970s):</strong> Integrated circuits that allowed for the development of personal computers.</li>
        <li><strong>Modern Era (1980s-Present):</strong> The rise of the internet, mobile computing, and advanced computing technologies like AI and machine learning.</li>
    </ul>
